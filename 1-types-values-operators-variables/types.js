  // This is a single-line comment. Whatever is written after two slashes will be ignored by the JS interpreter.
  // Single line comments can also follow code, as on line 1. 
  // You can also use mulit-line comments. Everthing in between /* and */ would be ignored by the interpreter.
  /*
    This is a mulit line comment! 
    Remember, you can nest single line comments within multi-line ones //like this
    But you can't nest multi-line comments within eachother or within single line comments!
    Play around with adding comments to these files. Maybe use comments to write yourself some reminders!

  /********************** Primitive Data Types and Operators ********************
    Alright, let's jump right to it! Remember, google is your best friend, so if you need to research something, ask your good friend google! I like to reference MDN myself. 
    Here's the MDN link for primitive data types.
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
    
    And here's a brief reminder (remember, we are focusing on the ES5 spec, as ES6 hasn't been fully implemented as a standard in most browsers yet. We are therefore ignoring ES6 specifics.)
    In Javascript there are 5 Primitive Values.
      Undefined - a variable that has not been assigned a value             - undefined

      Null - the intentional absence of a value, not the same as undefined! - null
      
      Boolean - represents a logical entity, either true or false           - true/false
      
      String - a sequence of characters used to represent textual data.
               a string is any characters wrapped in either single or       - 'a string'
               double quotes. Be consistent in your use of single or 
               double quotes, I personally prefer using singles in js 
               and using doubles in html.                                   - "another string"
            
               
      Number - Unlike languages like C, javascript only has one number type - 3.14159265359
               for floats, doubles and ints. All numerical data types are   - 100
               represented by a number.                                     - -32536

      ********************** Variables ***********************************
      Again, we are focusing on ES5 standards, which means we will be declaring varibales only using the 'var' keyword. Feel free to read up on the newest additions in ES6.
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Declarations

      Remember algebra? Stuff like:
      x + 10 = 13
      x = _?
      back in algebra class, you would do problems like this, and your task was to find the value of x. Well in programming we use varibales as well. 
      Think of a variable as a container, like a box. You put a name on the box, and store whatever value you want in it. In javascript, we can assign any value to a variable!

      We use the assignment operator '=' to assign values to variables.
      var name = 'Tony';
      console.log(name);
      Try opening your developer console and play around with variables such as the two above lines.


      ******************** Operators ********************
      There are lots of operators in javascript, so many that I won't try to list them all. Here's the link!
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators

      But to list a couple
      
      = assignment. Used to assign a value to a variable, such as var name = 'Tony';
      
      == equal. Returns true if operands are equal, such as 3 == '3'; // returns true
      
      === strict equal. Returns true if operands are equal and the same type, such as 3 === '3' //returns false, because one is a number and the other is a string. 3 === 3 would return true
      
      != not equal. Returns true if operands are not equal, such as 3 != '3' // returns false, because the number and the value of the string are both 3, even though they aren't the same type
      
      !== strict not equal. Returns true if operands are not equal and not the same type, such as 3 !== '3' // 
      returns true because though the values of the number and string are both 3, they are not the same type!

      > greater than. Returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, such as 3 > 4 // returns false

      >= greater than or equal to. Returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, such as 3 >= 3 // returns true

      < less than. Returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, such as 3 < 4 // returns true

      <= less than or equal to. Returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, such as 3 <= 3 // returns true

      
      There are a lot of other operators, so check out the documentation to find out what they are and what they do!
      For example, you will need to use the arithmetic operators to pass some of the tests. Notice they weren't explained above, so you'll need to look them up. But since I'm nice, I won't make you scroll up for that link.

/******************
Now for the fun bit! There was some code to get you started on the last section.
For this section, read the tests (either in the test/spec.js file, or right there in the browser). Figure out what the tests are looking for, and make them pass.
This may seem like some form of cruel punishment, but have faith, this will help you learn! 
TDD, or Test Driven Development is (or should be) the 
standard way to write code. 
You write tests (that all fail) showing the expected behavior of your code. Then you write code that makes the tests pass. 
Writing tests is something that will be gone over later, for now just focus on understanding the tests. 
I think you'll be surprised that you'll be able to 
understand what we're looking for!
