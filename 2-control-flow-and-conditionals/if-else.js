  From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions

  "An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

  Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluates and therefore resolves to value.

  The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

  The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable."

  So far we have been working with expressions, now we are going to start working with block statements. 

  From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block

  "A block statement (or compound statement in other languages) is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets."

  We are going to use the comparison operators and learn about control flow statements in the next section.

  The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements. 
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow  

*/
// The first control flow statements we will use are 'if', 'else if', and 'else'. 
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else
// Those statements work like this.
/*
  You can have a block of code run if the condition you check is true by using the if statement.

  if (condition) {
    run this code if condition evaluates to true
  } 

  ------------------------------------------

  You can also have a block of code run if the condition is false by using the else statement.

  if (condition) {
    run this code if condition evaluates to true
  } else {
    run this code if condition is false
  }

  ------------------------------------------

  Finally, you can check multiple conditions, and have seperate blocks of code run if one of them is true.
  Check the first condition with the if statement, then as many other conditions as you like with the else if statement.
  Don't forget to use the else statement at the end whenever you use if/else if, so some code runs in the event that all conditions are false

  if (conditionA) {
    run this code if conditionA evaluates to true
  } else if (conditionB) {
    run this code if conditionB evaluates to true
  } else {
    run this code if all conditions are false
  }

// Let see put that into action!
// The first couple of tests are passing as an example.

// create a variable called flowAnswerA.
var flowAnswerA;
// if flowC is greater than or equal to flowB assign flowAnswerA true. Otherwise asign fAnswerA false.
if (flowC >= flowB) {
  flowAnswerA = true;
} else {
  flowAnswerA = false;
}

// create a variable flowAnswerB

// if flowB is strictly equal (the same value and type) to flowD assign flowAnswerB true.


// create a variable flowAnswerC

// if flowB equals (in a truthy kind of way) flowD assign flowAnswerC true

// create a variable called flowAnswerD.

// if flowE plus flowG is bigger than flowG plus flowF, assign flowAnswerD the value of flowG plus flowE. Otherwise assign it the value of flowG plus flowF.

// create a variable called flowAnswerE.

// if flowA is equal to flowE assign flowAnswerE false. Otherwise assign it true.

// create a variable called flowAnswerF. 

// assign flowAnswerF the value of flowE multiplied by flowF.

// create a variable called flowAnswerG

// flowAnswerG should hold the greater of flowAnswerF, and flowG.
// if they have the same value, then flowAnswerG should have a value of true.


// create a variable called flowAnswerH.

// assign it the value of flowG * negative one.

// create a varibale called flowAnswerI

// if flowAnswerF is greater than flowAnswerG flowAnswerI gets true.
// if flowAnswerG is greater than flowAnswerF flowAnswerI gets false.
// Otherwise flowAnswerI gets 'woo hoo!'
